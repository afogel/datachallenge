            <h3>Example Scenario: Asymptomatic and Surface Spread</h3>
            <p>
              Among the things the general population and government officials now know is that asymptomatic individuals can transmit the virus, and that hard surfaces (among others) can hold the virus for later transmission. This misunderstanding arguably kept WHO from declaring a pandemic until March. It also led to public officials making blatantly inaccurate statements or engaged in blatantly hazardous conduct (e.g., drinking in crowded bars) into March. In practical terms, actual transmissibility factors, as now understood, means that every person should treat themselves as possibly infected, and should treat every surface as infected, and should treat others as possibly infected.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Challenge:</b>​ Create models to track on a weekly basis of news articles or official pronouncements over the evolving understanding of transmissibility. Network nodes would include assurances and warnings about transmissibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Why this matters:</b>​ Inaccurate understandings of transmissibility arguably dramatically accelerated pandemic spread rates, and remaining misunderstandings will undermine recovery.

                <h3>Example Scenario: Confirmed Cases versus Actual Spread</h3>
                <p>
                  The daily count of new confirmed cases is arguably a function of two major variables: infection spread and testing capacity. It significantly underestimates actual spread. Yet increases in the confirmed cases seem repeatedly taken as indications of spread alone. This is highly misleading, in that it treats confirmed cases as a proxy for spread, badly underestimating spread, and is an inherently incorrect value for the rate of spread.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Challenge:</b>​ Create models to track co-occurrence of news articles relaying confirmed case counts with qualifying statements about actual count, about confirmed case counts as low estimate, clarity about actual spread as affected by testing capacity, direct statement or inferencing that confirmed cases is the indicator of spread.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Why this matters:</b>​ Public understanding of the nature of spread rates is critical. When confirmed cases are low, public attention is slow. During the current period of early April, a daily increase in the US that is constantly fluctuating in the 25-35K range likely reflects maximum testing capacity rather than actual spread. There are arguably 1.5m or more cases in the US. Let’s say by April 30, the figure is 1.6 million, reflecting mitigation and recovery. Over a three week period, 600,000 confirmed cases are added. The public treats this as increasing spread at a doubling rate rather than a 7% increase. The confirmed case count drastically understates what the general public should be aware of and also overstates.

                <h3>Example Scenario 1: Face Masks</h3>
                <p>
                  WHO has repeatedly noted that there is no proven effect of the value of non-medical grade face masks. Yet some countries with notable success in mitigating viral spread practice face masking nearly ubiquitously (e.g., Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore), though there are exceptions to their success. Different countries are now adopting either strong recommendations or requirements for face masks. It is quite possible that with more accurate understanding of transmissibility and ubiquitous use of face masks in Iran, Europe and US, the pandemic would be much less severe. This scenario does not seek to answer that question, but does seek to model policy recommendations and requirements concerning what is likely to become widespread practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Challenge:</b>​ Create models to track evolution of discourse on face masks, with nodes representing issues such as concerns of availability for health workers, lack of gold-standard evidence of effectiveness for non-medical grade masks, WHO recommendations, individual country recommendations (e.g., CDC), types of face masks, expected efficacy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Why this matters:</b>​ Public understanding of each individual’s agency and responsibility in both personal protection and protection of others will be a crucial part of the recovery process.
                </p>
                <h3>Example Scenario 2: Political Unity</h3>
                <p>
                  A common expression in times of crisis is that crisis unifies a population. The means by which unity and camaraderie of spirit have evidenced themselves in the pandemic are moving and inspiring. Political leaders in different countries have very different profiles of unity in the crisis.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Challenge:</b>​ Create models to track evolution of tone of discourse in different countries, with nodes representing both specific and general factors (policies on closings, ventilator availability, etc.) and something like the collaborative or cooperative valence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Why this matters:</b>​ Despite some successes in people working across partisan divides, leadership in many countries has simply failed to rise above acrimony when collaboration and joint problem-solving is necessary.
